# Quantum Maze Solver

**Quantum Maze Solver** is a quantum-inspired, distributed 3D maze-solving engine combining post-quantum cryptography, tensor-based pathfinding, AI optimization, and enterprise-grade metrics. It simulates hybrid quantum-classical computation with a secure cryptographic vault and neural architecture for entangled learning.

## Core Features

- üß† **Quantum-Inspired 3D Maze Generator**  
  Entangled maze structure built using TensorFlow tensor operations with probabilistic path validation.

- üîó **Hybrid Quantum-Classical Solver**  
  Multi-threaded distributed solver with simulated quantum annealing and optimization logic.

- üîê **Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Suite**  
  Integration of Kyber (KEM) and Dilithium (signature) algorithms for encrypted maze solution encapsulation.

- üìà **Enterprise Metrics with Prometheus**  
  Exposes custom metrics like `maze_solve_seconds` and `crypto_operations_total` via `/metrics` endpoint.

- ‚ö° **Redis-Based Distributed Coordination**  
  Session management and inter-worker communication using Redis Cluster.

- üß¨ **Quantum GNN (Graph Neural Network)**  
  Neural architecture designed to train on entangled maze data using attention layers and GELU activation.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js  
- TensorFlow.js (GPU)  
- Redis Cluster  
- `@datastructures-js/priority-queue`  
- `quantum-resistant-lib` (Kyber + Dilithium)  
- Prometheus + Opossum (Circuit Breaker)

## API Endpoints

- `POST /solve`  
  Triggers full maze generation, distributed solve, encryption, and returns a sealed solution.

- `GET /metrics`  
  Prometheus-compatible metrics output.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
````

2. Start Redis Cluster locally (or edit client config).

3. Launch the server:

   ```bash
   node near-quantum.js
   ```

4. Send POST request to `http://localhost:3000/solve`
